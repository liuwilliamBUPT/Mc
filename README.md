# MC Server Installer
This is a shell script to install Minecraft server without forge.

There are a lot of things to do.

# To do List 
1. It seems like forge-\$forgeversion-installer.jar can install minecraft server directly, when there is not minecraft_server.\$version.jar. 

2. Make it possible to accept parameters.
